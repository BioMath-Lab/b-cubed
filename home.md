We are excited to introduce you to the official documentation website for the [B-Cubed project](http://b-cubed.eu/) - your gateway to unlocking the full potential of data cubes. 

This website contains comprehensive explanations of the available APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), making it
easier for users to integrate the B-Cubed toolbox with external systems and services. Particular emphasis is placed on
maintaining the toolbox's cloud-agnostic nature. Detailed guidelines are provided to facilitate the utilization of 
occurrence cubes on various cloud platforms.

Moreover, the documentation covers the integration of species occurrence cubes with existing environmental layers 
hosted on different cloud providers. Valuable insights from work packages WP4-6 will be incorporated into practical
workflows, showcasing how to employ occurrence cubes for specific data outputs.
