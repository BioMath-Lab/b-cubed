# B-Cubed - BioMath, Stellenbosch

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
Welcome to the Mathematical Biosciences (BioMath) GitHub repository, a dedicated space for advancing the understanding and conservation of biodiversity through computational science. Here, we offer an array of R and Python workflows and coding tutorials designed specifically for modeling ecosystem complexity. Our resources are tailored to support researchers, conservationists, and students in their quest to unravel the intricate dynamics of ecosystems and to apply these insights towards effective biodiversity conservation strategies. Whether you are looking to enhance your analytical skills, develop sophisticated models, or explore innovative approaches to ecological research, our repository serves as a bridge between mathematical biosciences and practical conservation efforts. Dive into our content to discover tools and techniques that empower data-driven decision-making and foster a deeper connection with the natural world.

<!--
We are excited to introduce you to the official documentation website for the  - your gateway to unlocking the full potential of data cubes. 

This website contains comprehensive explanations of the available APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), making it easier for users to integrate the B-Cubed toolbox with external systems and services. Particular emphasis is placed on maintaining the toolbox's cloud-agnostic nature. Detailed guidelines are provided to facilitate the utilization of occurrence cubes on various cloud platforms.

Moreover, the documentation covers the integration of species occurrence cubes with existing environmental layers hosted on different cloud providers. Valuable insights from work packages WP4-6 will be incorporated into practical workflows, showcasing how to employ occurrence cubes for specific data outputs.
