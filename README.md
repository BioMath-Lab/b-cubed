## Mathematical Biosciences Lab
Our lab is a multidisciplinary research team at the interface of mathematics and biology/life sciences. As part of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, we are a dynamic research group led by Prof Cang Hui, a SARChI Chair in Mathematical and Theoretical Physical Biosciences. Our interests lie in proposing models and theories for explaining emerging patterns in ecology. Ecology studies biodiversity in its variety and complexity. As ecological processes are highly complex and adaptive, we rely on the simplicity of mathematical language to build models and theoretical frameworks.

## BioMath Documents
Welcome to the Mathematical Biosciences (BioMath) GitHub repository, a dedicated space for advancing the understanding and conservation of biodiversity through computational science. Here, we offer an array of R and Python workflows and coding tutorials designed specifically for modeling ecosystem complexity. Our resources are tailored to support researchers, conservationists, and students in their quest to unravel the intricate dynamics of ecosystems and to apply these insights towards effective biodiversity conservation strategies. Whether you are looking to enhance your analytical skills, develop sophisticated models, or explore innovative approaches to ecological research, our repository serves as a bridge between mathematical biosciences and practical conservation efforts. Dive into our content to discover tools and techniques that empower data-driven decision-making and foster a deeper connection with the natural world.
