This documentation website will serve as a hub for information on how to effectively use the B3 toolbox.

The website will contain comprehensive explanations of the available APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), making it
easier for users to integrate the toolbox with external systems and services. Special attention will be given to maintaining
the B-Cubed toolbox's cloud-agnostic nature. Detailed guidelines will be provided for utilizing occurrence cubes on various cloud
platforms.
